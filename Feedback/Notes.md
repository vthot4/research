# Feedback



### Giving effective feedback

> Feedback is a vital part of education and training which, if carried out well, helps motivate and develop learners’
> knowledge, skills and behaviours.

- If feedback is not given, the learner might assume that he/she has no areas for improvement or development. Learners value feedback, especially when given by someone whom they respect for their knowledge, attitudes or clinical competence.
- Feedback should be given when asked to do so or when your offer is accepted and as soon after the event as possible. The overall focus is on the positive and should be part of the overall communication process and ‘developmental dialogue’. To be effective it is important to develop rapport, mutual respect and trust between you and the learner.

- Feedback needs to be given privately wherever possible, especially more negative feedback and in doing so, try to stay in the ‘here and now’.
- Remember that feedback is for the recipient, not the giver: be sensitive to the impact of your message. Consider the content of the message, the process of giving feedback and the congruence between your verbal and non-verbal messages.
- Other models include the ‘feedback sandwich’ which starts and ends with positive feedback, with the aspects for improvement ‘sandwiched’ in between and ‘Pendleton’s rules’ (Pendleton et al, 1984).



### The Art of Giving and Receiving Feedback.

- In the workplace, there are two types of acts about which we generally provide feedback: job performance and work-related behaivor:
  - **job performance** involves competency --whether or not an employee is capably performing specific tasks that have been assigned.
  - **Work-related behabiour** involves the way in wich an employee performs his or her tasks --whether he or she speaks politely to customers, for example, and works cooperatively with other team members.
- Two types of feedback:
  - **Redirection** identifies job-related behaviors and performance that do not contribute to individual, group, and organizational goals and helps the employee develop alternative strategies.
  - **Reinforcement** identifies job-related behaviors and performance that contribute to individual, group, and organizational goals and encourages the employee to repeat and develop them.  

- When feedback takes the form of redirection and reinforcement, it has a number of useful characteristics:
  - It is focused on acts, not attitude.
  - It is directed toward the future.
  - It is goal oriented.
  - It is multidirectional.
  - It is supportive.
  - It is continual.

- We can make sure that feedback is detailed by remembering these simple guidelines:
  - Detailed feedback is specific.
  - Detailed feedback is accurate.
  - Detailed feedback is inquiring.
